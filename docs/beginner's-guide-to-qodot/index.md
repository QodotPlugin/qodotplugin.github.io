# Beginner's Guide to Qodot

Welcome! If you get stuck at any time, feel free to ask us on the [Qodot Discord](https://discord.gg/c72WBuG).

## Prerequisites

You should have the latest stable version of both [Trenchbroom](https://trenchbroom.github.io/) and [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) installed.

It helps to know the basics of navigating in Godot's 3D editor and Trenchbroom's 3D editor.

The [Additional Resources](../additional-resources.html) page has a list of resources to learn more about using Trenchbroom and Godot if you get stuck.

## Getting Started

To get started with Qodot, you can read:

1. [Installation](installation.md) to install the plugin from a blank, or otherwise Qodot-less project.
2. [Building Maps](building-maps.md) to learn the absolute basics of building maps.
3. [Applying Textures](applying-textures.md) to learn how to apply your Godot project's textures to geometry using Trenchbroom.

After reading all three pages, you will be able to build and texture maps for Godot using Trenchbroom.
